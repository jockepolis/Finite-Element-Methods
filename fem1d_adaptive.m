function fem1d_adaptive ( )

%*****************************************************************************80
%
%% fem1d_adaptive() solves a 1D problem using an adaptive finite element method.
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    The equation to be treated is:
%
%      -d/dx ( P(x) * dU(x)/dx ) + Q(x) * U(x)  =  F(x)
%
%    by the finite-element method using piecewise linear basis
%    functions.
%
%    An adaptive method is used to try to reduce the maximum
%    error by refining the mesh in certain places.
%
%    Here U is an unknown scalar function of X defined on the
%    interval [XL,XR], and P, Q and F are given functions of X.
%
%    The values of U at XL and XR are also specified.
%
%    The interval [XL,XR] is "meshed" with N+1 points,
%
%      XN(0) = XL, XN(1) = XL+H, XN(2) = XL+2*H, ..., XN(N) = XR.
%
%    This creates N subintervals, with interval I having endpoints 
%    XN(I-1) and XN(I).
%
%    The algorithm tries to guarantee a certain amount
%    of accuracy by examining the current solution, estimating the error
%    in each subinterval, and, if necessary, subdividing one or more
%    subintervals and repeating the calculation.
%
%    We can think of the adaptive part of the algorithm as a refined
%    problem.  The program re-solves the problem on the pair of
%    intervals J and J+1, which extend from node J-1 to node J+1.
%    The values of U that were just computed at nodes J-1 and J+1
%    will be used as the boundary values for this refined problem.
%    The intervals J and J+1 will each be evenly divided into NY
%    smaller subintervals.  This boundary value problem is solved,
%    and the derivatives of the original and refined solutions are
%    then compared to get an estimate of the error.

%  Local:
%
%    real ADIAG(NU).
%    ADIAG(I) is the "diagonal" coefficient of the I-th
%    equation in the linear system.  That is, ADIAG(I) is
%    the coefficient of the I-th unknown in the I-th equation.
%
%    real ALEFT(NU).
%    ALEFT(I) is the "left hand" coefficient of the I-th
%    equation in the linear system.  That is, ALEFT(I) is the
%    coefficient of the (I-1)-th unknown in the I-th equation.
%    There is no value in ALEFT(1), since the first equation
%    does not refer to a "0-th" unknown.
%
%    real ARITE(NU).
%    ARITE(I) is the "right hand" coefficient of the I-th
%    equation in the linear system.  ARITE(I) is the coefficient
%    of the (I+1)-th unknown in the I-th equation.  There is
%    no value in ARITE(NU) because the NU-th equation does not
%    refer to an "NU+1"-th unknown.
%
%    real ETA(N).
%    ETA(I) is the error estimate for interval I.  It is computed
%    as the sum of two quantities, one associated with the left
%    and one with the right node of the interval.
%
%    real F(NU).
%    ASSEMBLE stores into F the right hand side of the linear
%    equations.
%    SOLVE replaces those values of F by the solution of the
%    linear equations.
%
%    real FY(M).
%    FY is the right hand side of the linear system of the refined
%    problem.
%
%    real H(N)
%    H(I) is the length of subinterval I.  This code uses
%    equal spacing for all the subintervals.
%
%    real HY(M).
%    HY(I) is the length of subinterval I in the refined problem.
%
%    integer IBC.
%    IBC declares what the boundary conditions are.
%    1, at the left endpoint, U has the value UL,
%       at the right endpoint, U' has the value UR.
%    2, at the left endpoint, U' has the value UL,
%       at the right endpoint, U has the value UR.
%    3, at the left endpoint, U has the value UL,
%       and at the right endpoint, U has the value UR.
%    4, at the left endpoint, U' has the value UL,
%       at the right endpoint U' has the value UR.
%
%    integer IBCY.
%    IBCY declares the boundary conditions for the refined problem
%    which should always be that the value of U is specified at
%    both the left and right endpoints.  This corresponds to a
%    value of IBCY = 3.
%
%    integer INDX(0:N).
%    For a node I, INDX(I) is the index of the unknown
%    associated with node I.
%    If INDX(I) is equal to -1, then no unknown is associated
%    with the node, because a boundary condition fixing the
%    value of U has been applied at the node instead.
%    Unknowns are numbered beginning with 1.
%    If IBC is 2 or 4, then there is an unknown value of U
%    at node 0, which will be unknown number 1.  Otherwise,
%    unknown number 1 will be associated with node 1.
%    If IBC is 1 or 4, then there is an unknown value of U
%    at node N, which will be unknown N or N+1,
%    depending on whether there was an unknown at node 0.
%
%    integer INDY(0:M).
%    INDY(I) records the index of the unknown associated with
%    node I for the refined problem.
%
%    integer JADD(N).
%    JADD(I) is 1 if the error estimates show that interval I
%    should be subdivided.
%
%    integer KOUNT, the number of adaptive steps that have been taken.
%
%    integer M.
%    M is the number of subintervals used in the refined problem.
%    M is equal to NY for computations centered at node 0 or node N,
%    and otherwise, M is equal to 2*NY.
%
%    integer N
%    The number of subintervals into which the interval
%    [XL,XR] is broken.
%
%    integer NL.
%    The number of basis functions used in a single
%    subinterval.  (NL-1) is the degree of the polynomials
%    used.  For this code, NL is fixed at 2, meaning that
%    piecewise linear functions are used as the basis.
%
%    integer NMAX, the maximum number of unknowns that can be handled.
%
%    integer NODE(NL,N).
%    For each subinterval I:
%    NODE(1,I) is the number of the left node, and
%    NODE(2,I) is the number of the right node.
%
%    integer NODEY(NL,M).
%    NODEY performs the same function for the refined problem that
%    NODE performs for the full problem, recording the node numbers
%    associated with a particular subinterval.
%
%    integer NQUAD
%    The number of quadrature points used in a subinterval.
%
%    integer NU.
%    NU is the number of unknowns in the linear system.
%    Depending on the value of IBC, there will be N-1,
%    N, or N+1 unknown values, which are the coefficients
%    of basis functions.
%
%    integer NUY.
%    The number of unknowns in the refined problem.
%
%    integer NY.
%    NY is the number of subintervals into which a given interval
%    will be subdivided, before solving the refined probelm.
%
%    integer PROBLEM, chooses the problem to be solved.
%    The user must choose this value by setting it in routine GETPRB.
%    * 1, u = x, p = 1, q = 0, f = 0, ibc = 3, ul = 0, ur = 1.
%    The program should find the solution exactly, and the
%    adaptive code should find that there is no reason to
%    subdivide any interval.
%    * 2, u = x*x, p = 1, q = 0, f = -2, ibc = 3, ul = 0, ur = 1.

%    the adaptive code should again find there is nothing
%    to do.

%    *5: u = x**(beta+2)/((beta+2)*(beta+1)), p = 1, q = 1, ibc = 3, 
%    f = -x**beta + (x**(beta+2))/((beta+2)*(beta+1)),
%    ul = 0, ur = 1/((beta+2)*(beta+1))
%    (beta must be greater than -2, and not equal to -1)
%    *6: u = atan((x-0.5)/alpha), p = 1, q = 0, ibc = 3, 
%    f =  2*alpha*(x-0.5) / (alpha^2 + (x-0.5)^2) ^2,
%    ul = u(0), ur = u(1)
%

%  Discussion:
%
%    SOLVEY accepts information about the solution of a finite element
%    problem on a grid of nodes with coordinates XN.  It then starts
%    at node 0, and for each node, computes two "error estimators",
%    one for the left, and one for the right interval associated with the
%    node.  These estimators are found by solving a finite element problem
%    over the two intervals, using the known values of the original
%    solution as boundary data, and using a mesh that is "slightly"
%    refined over the original one.
%
%    Note that the computations at the 0-th and N-th nodes only involve
%    a single interval.
